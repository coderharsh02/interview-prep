Before Cloud:

Example 1 - Online Shopping App

Challenge:
    Peak usage during holidays and weekends
    Less load during rest of the time
    
Solution (before the Cloud):
    Procure (Buy) infrastructure for peak load

Cons:
    What would the infrastructure be doing during periods of low loads?
    (Low utilization of resources)


Example 2 - Startup

Challenge:
    It suddenly becomes popular.
    How to handle the sudden increase in load?

Solution (before the Cloud):
    Procure (Buy) infrastructure assuming they would be successful
    What if they are not successful?
    (You have to sell all the infrastructure at half or even less price)


Before the Cloud - Challenges

    High cost of procuring infrastructure
    Needs ahead of time planning (Can you guess the future?)
    Low infrastructure utilization (PEAK LOAD provisioning)
    Dedicated infrastructure maintenance team (Can a startup afford it?)

Silver Lining in the Cloud

How about provisioning (renting) resources when you want them and 
releasing them back when you do not need them?

On-Demand Resource Provisioning (Elasticity)

Cloud - Advantages

    Trade "capital expense" for "variable expense"
    Benefit from massive economies of scale
    Stop guessing capacity
    Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
    "Go global" in minutes
