Describe the Benefits of High Availability and Scalability in the Cloud

### High Availability
1. **Definition**: Focuses on ensuring IT resources are accessible and operational when needed, even during disruptions or events.
2. **Importance**: Ensures continuous uptime and reliability for applications and services.
3. **Service-Level Agreements (SLAs)**: Azure provides uptime guarantees as part of its SLAs, which define the expected availability of services.
4. **Resource Planning**: Requires accounting for service availability guarantees during solution architecture.

### Scalability
1. **Definition**: Refers to the ability to adjust cloud resources to meet varying demand levels.
2. **Handling Demand**: Enables adding resources to manage peak traffic and scaling down when demand decreases.
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Aligns costs with actual usage due to the consumption-based model, avoiding overpayment for unused resources.
4. **Types of Scaling**:
   - **Vertical Scaling**:
     - **Increase/Decrease Capabilities**: Adjusts the power of individual resources (e.g., adding more CPUs or RAM to a virtual machine).
     - **Example**: Scaling up for more processing power or scaling down if resources are over-provisioned.
   - **Horizontal Scaling**:
     - **Scale Out/In**: Involves adding or removing instances of resources (e.g., virtual machines or containers) to handle changes in demand.
     - **Example**: Adding more virtual machines during high demand or removing them during low demand.

### Summary
- **High Availability** ensures maximum uptime and reliability.
- **Scalability** provides flexibility in resource management and cost efficiency by adjusting to demand changes through vertical or horizontal scaling.
