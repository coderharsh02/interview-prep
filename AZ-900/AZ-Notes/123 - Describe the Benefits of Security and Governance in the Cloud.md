Describe the Benefits of Security and Governance in the Cloud

### Governance
1. **Compliance and Standards**:
   - **Templates**: Use predefined templates to ensure deployed resources meet corporate and regulatory standards.
   - **Updates**: Easily update resources to align with evolving standards and regulations.
2. **Auditing**:
   - **Cloud-Based Audits**: Flag resources that do not comply with corporate standards.
   - **Mitigation Strategies**: Provides guidance on how to address compliance issues.
3. **Automatic Updates**:
   - **Software Patches**: Depending on the operating model, cloud services may automatically apply patches and updates, aiding governance and security.

### Security
1. **Customizable Security**:
   - **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Offers physical resources with control over operating systems and software, including patch management and maintenance.
   - **Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS)**: These models handle patches and maintenance automatically, reducing the burden on users.
2. **Robust Protection**:
   - **DDoS Mitigation**: Cloud providers are equipped to handle distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, enhancing network security.

### Summary
- **Governance**: Ensures compliance through templates, automated updates, and auditing, keeping resources aligned with standards and regulations.
- **Security**: Provides options for varying levels of control and automatic updates, with robust protection against threats like DDoS attacks.
