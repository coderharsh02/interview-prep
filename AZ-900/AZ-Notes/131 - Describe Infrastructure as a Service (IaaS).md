Describe Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

### Overview
1. **Definition**:
   - **Flexibility**: IaaS provides maximum control over cloud resources, offering the highest level of customization.
   - **Provider Responsibilities**: The cloud provider handles hardware, network connectivity, and physical security.
   - **User Responsibilities**: You manage operating system installation, configuration, maintenance, network configuration, database setup, and storage.

### Shared Responsibility Model
1. **Provider Responsibilities**:
   - **Physical Infrastructure**: Maintenance of hardware and network connectivity.
   - **Physical Security**: Ensuring the security of the data center.
2. **User Responsibilities**:
   - **Installation and Configuration**: Managing the operating system, applications, and services.
   - **Patching and Updates**: Keeping systems and software up to date.
   - **Security**: Ensuring the security of the operating system, applications, and data.

### Common Scenarios for IaaS
1. **Lift-and-Shift Migration**:
   - **Description**: Moving existing applications from an on-premises data center to IaaS infrastructure without redesigning the applications.
   - **Use Case**: When you want to replicate your on-premises environment in the cloud.
2. **Testing and Development**:
   - **Description**: Rapidly creating and managing development and test environments.
   - **Use Case**: When you need to quickly spin up or shut down environments while maintaining complete control over configurations.

### Summary
- **IaaS** offers high flexibility and control, with the cloud provider handling physical infrastructure while the user manages software and security.
- **Shared Responsibility** model divides duties between the provider and the user, emphasizing user management of configurations and security.
- **Use Cases** include migrating existing systems to the cloud and managing dynamic development and test environments.
