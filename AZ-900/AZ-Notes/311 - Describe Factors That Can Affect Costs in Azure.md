Describe Factors That Can Affect Costs in Azure

### **Factors Affecting Costs in Azure**

1. **Resource Type**
   - **Variables**: Type of resource, settings, and region impact costs.
   - **Examples**:
     - **Storage**: Blob type, performance tier, access tier, redundancy settings, and region.
     - **Virtual Machines (VMs)**: OS licensing, processor cores, attached storage, network interface, and region.

2. **Consumption**
   - **Pay-As-You-Go**: Costs based on actual usage during a billing cycle.
   - **Reserved Instances**: Commit to using specific resources for 1 or 3 years for discounts up to 72%. Flexibility to handle sudden demand surges.

3. **Maintenance**
   - **Resource Management**: Regularly review and deprovision unused resources to control costs. Ensure associated resources are also deprovisioned.

4. **Geography**
   - **Regional Pricing**: Costs vary by region due to differences in power, labor, taxes, and fees.
   - **Network Traffic**: Inbound data is often free, but outbound data transfer pricing varies by geographical zones.

5. **Subscription Type**
   - **Trial and Free Tiers**: Free trials offer access to certain products and credits. Subscription types may include usage allowances affecting overall costs.

6. **Azure Marketplace**
   - **Third-Party Solutions**: Purchasing from Azure Marketplace may involve additional costs for third-party services or products. Billing structures are set by the vendor.

These factors collectively influence Azure costs and require careful management to optimize spending.
