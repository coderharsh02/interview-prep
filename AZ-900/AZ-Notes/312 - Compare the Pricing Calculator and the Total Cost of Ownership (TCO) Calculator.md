     - Provides cost estimates for individual Azure resources.
     - Allows configuration of scenarios to estimate Azure spend.
     - Focuses on the cost of provisioned Azure resources, including compute, storage, and network.
     - **Note**: Estimates only; no actual provisioning or charges occur.
   - **TCO Calculator**:
     - Compares current on-premises infrastructure costs with Azure costs.
     - Requires input of existing infrastructure details, such as servers, databases, and storage.
     - Considers additional costs like power and IT labor.
     - Outputs a comparison of costs between maintaining current infrastructure and moving to Azure.

3. **Usage**
   - **Pricing Calculator**: For estimating costs of Azure resources and configurations.
   - **TCO Calculator**: For evaluating the financial benefits of migrating from on-premises to Azure infrastructure.
