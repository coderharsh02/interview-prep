Describe Azure Resource Manager (ARM) and ARM templates


### **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) and ARM Templates**

1. **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)**
   - **Deployment & Management**: Service for creating, updating, and deleting Azure resources.
   - **Request Handling**: Receives requests from Azure tools, APIs, and SDKs, authenticates, and sends them to the Azure service.
   - **Consistent Interface**: Ensures uniform results and capabilities across different tools.

2. **Benefits of ARM**
   - **Declarative Templates**: Use JSON files to define desired deployments.
   - **Group Management**: Deploy and manage resources collectively rather than individually.
   - **Consistency**: Re-deploy solutions consistently across different stages.
   - **Dependency Management**: Defines resource dependencies for correct deployment order.
   - **Access Control**: Integrates with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
   - **Tagging**: Organizes resources and clarifies billing by tags.

3. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - **Concept**: Managing infrastructure using code, like Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI.
   - **Templates**: Use repeatable templates for managing deployments.

4. **ARM Templates**
   - **Declarative Format**: Defines resources in JSON; specifies desired state without detailed sequence commands.
   - **Benefits**:
     - **Repeatability**: Deploys consistent infrastructure across environments.
     - **Orchestration**: Manages resource creation order and parallel deployments.
     - **Modularity**: Breaks templates into reusable components.
     - **Extensibility**: Supports PowerShell/Bash scripts within templates.

5. **Bicep**
   - **Declarative Language**: Defines infrastructure in a simpler, more readable syntax compared to JSON.
   - **Benefits**:
     - **Support**: Immediate support for new resource types and API versions.
     - **Simplicity**: More concise and easier to read than JSON.
     - **Repeatability**: Ensures consistent deployments.
     - **Orchestration**: Handles resource ordering and parallel deployments.
     - **Modularity**: Uses modules for code reuse and simplified development.
