To help you prepare for the Microsoft SQL Server syllabus, I'll break down each topic and suggest a study plan. Here's a detailed outline:

### 1. **Complex Queries**
   - **Duration**: 1-2 weeks
   - **Key Topics**:
     - Joins: Left, Right, Full, Cross, Inner, Self, Cross Apply, Outer Apply.
     - Common Table Expressions (CTE), recursive CTE.
     - Pivot and Unpivot operations.
     - Query Hints, Table Variables.
     - XML and JSON DOM.
     - Temporary Tables: Local and Global.
     - Subqueries, correlated queries, dynamic queries.
     - Functions: Aggregate, String, Numeric, Ranking.
     - Result bifurcation using `GROUP BY` and `CASE WHEN`.
   - **Plan**:
     - **Week 1**: Focus on mastering Joins, CTEs, and basic functions.
     - **Week 2**: Work on advanced topics like Pivot/Unpivot, XML/JSON, and dynamic queries. Practice by writing complex queries daily.

### 2. **Complex Procedures**
   - **Duration**: 1 week
   - **Key Topics**:
     - Multiple parameters (including XML and JSON), Custom data types.
     - Exception handling, Error catching.
     - Cursors, Conditional logic (IF conditions).
     - CRUD operations within stored procedures.
   - **Plan**:
     - **First Half**: Learn to write and optimize stored procedures with multiple parameters and exception handling.
     - **Second Half**: Practice using cursors, conditional logic, and CRUD operations within stored procedures.

### 3. **User Defined Functions**
   - **Duration**: 3-4 days
   - **Key Topics**:
     - Table-valued and scalar functions.
   - **Plan**:
     - **Day 1-2**: Learn to create scalar and table-valued functions.
     - **Day 3-4**: Practice creating UDFs to solve complex logical problems.

### 4. **Views**
   - **Duration**: 3-4 days
   - **Key Topics**:
     - Complex views, view permissions, indexed views.
   - **Plan**:
     - **Day 1-2**: Focus on creating complex views and setting permissions.
     - **Day 3-4**: Learn about indexed views and how they can optimize performance.

### 5. **Triggers**
   - **Duration**: 3-4 days
   - **Key Topics**:
     - After and Before triggers, Instead of triggers, Magic tables.
   - **Plan**:
     - **Day 1-2**: Understand and create After/Before triggers.
     - **Day 3-4**: Explore Instead of triggers and Magic tables, and practice creating triggers for various scenarios.

### 6. **Query Hints**
   - **Duration**: 2-3 days
   - **Key Topics**:
     - NoLock, Tablock, ForceIndex, UsingIndex, MAXRECURSION.
   - **Plan**:
     - **Day 1**: Learn the purpose and usage of each query hint.
     - **Day 2-3**: Practice applying these hints in different query scenarios.

### 7. **Conditional Queries**
   - **Duration**: 1 week
   - **Key Topics**:
     - IF statements, CASE WHEN, WHILE loop, Coalesce, STUFF, NullIf, IsNull, Exists, IN, Dynamic queries with parameters, Merge statement.
   - **Plan**:
     - **First Half**: Focus on conditional statements like IF, CASE WHEN, WHILE loop, and related functions.
     - **Second Half**: Practice dynamic queries and Merge statements with real-world scenarios.

### 8. **Performance Tuning**
   - **Duration**: 1-2 weeks
   - **Key Topics**:
     - Indexes: Clustered and Non-clustered.
     - Query monitoring using Profiler, Activity Monitor.
     - Eliminating sub-queries, optimizing joins, using CTEs, and temp tables efficiently.
     - Analyzing execution plans.
   - **Plan**:
     - **Week 1**: Learn the theory behind performance tuning, indexing, and query optimization.
     - **Week 2**: Practice by analyzing and optimizing real queries using the learned techniques.

### **Additional Tips**
- **Practice Daily**: Consistent practice is key. Work on real-world problems and projects to apply your learning.
- **Use Online Resources**: Use SQL Server documentation, tutorials, and forums for additional help.
- **Mock Projects**: Create mini-projects to test your understanding of each topic.

This plan should help you cover all the topics thoroughly. Feel free to adjust the timeline based on your pace and understanding.
