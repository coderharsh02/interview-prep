Here are the views that you can create to fulfill the requirements for Task 2.

### 1. View for Assets Not Allocated and InStock

```sql
CREATE VIEW [dbo].[UnallocatedInStockAssets] AS
SELECT AssetID, Name, BrandName, PurchasedDate, Warranty, Status
FROM [dbo].[Asset]
WHERE Status = 'InStock' AND AssetID NOT IN (SELECT AssetID FROM [dbo].[Allocation]);
```

### 2. View to Count Assets by BrandName and Display AssetNames

```sql
CREATE VIEW [dbo].[AssetCountByBrand] AS
SELECT 
    BrandName,
    STRING_AGG(Name, ', ') AS AssetNames,
    COUNT(*) AS NoofAssets
FROM [dbo].[Asset]
GROUP BY BrandName;
```

**Note**: The `STRING_AGG` function concatenates the asset names separated by commas.

### 3. View for Report of Users and Their Allocated Assets

```sql
CREATE VIEW [dbo].[UserAssetReport] AS
SELECT 
    u.UserName,
    a.Name AS AssetName,
    a.BrandName,
    a.Warranty,
    a.Status,
    al.AllocationDate
FROM [dbo].[User] u
JOIN [dbo].[Allocation] al ON u.UserID = al.UserID
JOIN [dbo].[Asset] a ON al.AssetID = a.AssetID;
```

### 4. View for Assets in Scraped Status

```sql
CREATE VIEW [dbo].[ScrapedAssets] AS
SELECT AssetID, Name, BrandName, PurchasedDate, Warranty, Status
FROM [dbo].[Asset]
WHERE Status = 'Scraped';
```

### 5. View for Brands with More Than 2 Assets

```sql
CREATE VIEW [dbo].[BrandsWithMoreThanTwoAssets] AS
SELECT BrandName, COUNT(*) AS AssetCount
FROM [dbo].[Asset]
GROUP BY BrandName
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;
```

These views should cover the required queries and provide the needed insights into the asset management system.
